## Codex mirror boundary

Resolve the named skill, tool, connector, and account against what is actually available in this Codex session before following the upstream steps. Do not infer connection, authentication, credits, or runtime parity from this mirror. Preserve the external product named upstream and report a concrete missing capability when required.

# Fix merge conflicts

## Trigger

Branch has unresolved merge conflicts and needs a reliable path to a buildable state.

## Workflow

1. Detect all conflicting files from git status and conflict markers.
2. Resolve each conflict with minimal, correctness-first edits.
3. Prefer preserving both sides when safe. Otherwise, choose the variant that compiles and keeps public behavior stable.
4. Regenerate lockfiles with package manager tools instead of hand-editing.
5. Run compile, lint, and relevant tests.
6. Stage resolved files and summarize key decisions.

## Guardrails

- Keep changes minimal and readable.
- Do not leave conflict markers in any file.
- Avoid broad refactors while resolving conflicts.
- Do not push or tag during conflict resolution.

## Output

- Files resolved
- Notable resolution choices
- Build/test outcome

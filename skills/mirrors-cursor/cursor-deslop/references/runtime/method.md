description: Remove AI-generated code slop and clean up code style

## Reference path base

Shell commands, bare/backticked paths and prose use the original skill root (two directories above this reference). References to the original file mean that root, including sibling skills and playbooks. Markdown link destinations are file-relative and have already been relocated; do not apply the command base to those links.


# Remove AI code slop

Check the diff against main and remove AI-generated slop introduced in the branch.

## Focus Areas

- Extra comments that are unnecessary or inconsistent with local style
- Defensive checks or try/catch blocks that are abnormal for trusted code paths
- Casts to `any` used only to bypass type issues
- Deeply nested code that should be simplified with early returns
- Other patterns inconsistent with the file and surrounding codebase

## Guardrails

- Keep behavior unchanged unless fixing a clear bug.
- Prefer minimal, focused edits over broad rewrites.
- Keep the final summary concise (1-3 sentences).

## Codex adaptation

Bound reads and payloads; route only when a real delegate exists. Required native capabilities: none; this is instruction-only. No external product dependency is required by the adapted path. No tool is required; an oversized payload gets a bounded sequential fallback. This candidate is promoted for the bounded path described here; unrelated runtime parity remains unproven. This is a guide-only adaptation.

# Guard the Context Window

The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token should be worth its cost.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Isolate large payloads.** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to subagents. The main context gets summaries, not raw data.
- **Don't read what you won't use.** Read selectively based on relevance. If a file isn't needed for the current task, skip it.
- **Keep frequently used content inline.** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time.
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.

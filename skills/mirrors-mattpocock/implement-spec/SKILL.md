You have been provided a spec. This spec should have tickets associated with it, describing how to implement the spec.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

The goal is the entire spec implemented on a single **integration branch**, with every ticket resolved the way the issue tracker closes work. Treat an invocation whose scope requests this workflow as authorization for its stated branch and tracker mutations. If the invocation explicitly requests branch-only work, use that branch and report the resulting handoff; do not add a second approval gate when the request already specifies the workflow.

The tickets are not a list of steps. They are a **task graph** with blocking relationships between them. This means there is always a **frontier** of tickets which are ready to be grabbed.

Communication to and from subagents should be sparse. Communicate primarily through **context pointers**: to the spec, tickets, research notes, and previous commits. Don't duplicate information already available via pointers.

**Implementer subagents** should be run in the background where possible for maximum concurrency.

## Steps

1. Read the spec and tickets to understand the task graph.

2. (optional) Use an **exploration subagent** to conduct any exploration required by the tickets - relevant codebase files or external documentation. Ensure the exploration subagent can save files - it should save its markdown notes in a directory outside the repo, accessible by all future subagents. This lets **implementer subagents** focus on implementation rather than exploration.

3. Create the integration branch. If the issue tracker closes work through PRs, or the user asks for one, open a draft PR after the first merge in step 5 (a branch with no commits ahead of main can't open one), marked as closing the spec and tickets.

4. Use **implementer subagents** to implement each ticket in the background where the native harness supports delegation and required isolation. Give each subagent its own worktree and branch when supported; otherwise work the frontier sequentially on the authorized branch while preserving ticket roles and blocking edges. Each implementer using an isolated worktree:
   - confirms its worktree is based on the integration branch before starting, and resets onto it if not;
   - calls the Skill tool with `tdd` to build the ticket;
   - merges the integration branch tip into its own branch before reporting done

5. Once an **implementer subagent** completes, merge its work to the integration branch with a **merger subagent**. If the native harness cannot support that role, the coordinator may integrate directly through the authorized merge path.

6. If this changes the **frontier** of available tickets, kick off more **implementer subagents** to work on the new tickets. If the native harness cannot support that delegation, continue sequentially while preserving the blocking edges.

7. Once all tickets are complete, call the Skill tool with `code-review` on the integration branch. Fix all issues raised by the code review in a single **implementer subagent**. If the native harness cannot support that role, the coordinator fixes them through the authorized implementation path.

8. If a draft PR exists, mark it ready for review. Otherwise, resolve each ticket the way the issue tracker closes work, and report the integration branch.

9. Clean up all **implementer subagent** worktrees.
